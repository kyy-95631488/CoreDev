### üíª Submitting Code Changes

To contribute code (e.g., bug fixes, new features, or improvements):

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/bug-name`).
3. Make your changes, following our [Code Style Guidelines](#code-style-guidelines).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

To set up the project locally for development:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A modern code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kyy-95631488/CoreDev
   cd coredev
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

5. **Run Linting**:
   Ensure your code adheres to our style guidelines:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   # or
   yarn lint
   ```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the codebase, please adhere to the following:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Follow the rules defined in `.eslintrc.json`. Use ESLint to check for issues:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **Formatting**: Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent code formatting. Run:
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```
- **CSS**: Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
- **Components**: Write reusable, modular React components in the `components/` directory.
- **File Naming**: Use `kebab-case` for file names (e.g., `my-component.tsx`).
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks are set up to run linting and formatting automatically.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a consistent commit message format to keep the project history clear:

- Use the format: `[type](scope): short description`
  - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
  - **Scope**: The part of the project affected (e.g., `components`, `pages`, `styles`)
  - **Example**: `feat(components): add new project card component`
- Keep messages concise but descriptive.
- Use present tense (e.g., "add" instead of "added").

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the [Code Style Guidelines](#code-style-guidelines).
2. Update the `README.md` or other documentation if your changes affect it.
3. Submit a Pull Request to the `main` branch with:
   - A clear title and description of your changes.
   - Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
   - Screenshots or GIFs for UI changes (if applicable).
4. Wait for a review from the CoreDev team. Address any feedback promptly.
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged!
